        <p>
            Hello there ! I am Anthony Lim, a software engineer student enrolled in a Co-op program at Concordia. 
            Previously, I have completed a Computer Science and Mathematics Degree at College Bois-De-Boulogne. 
            I'm passionate about web development and building innovative applications that address real-world challenges. 
            I have experience in back-end development with Node.js, Express and MongoDB and front-end development with React.js.
